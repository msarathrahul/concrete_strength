**Data Overview:**
- Type: Multivariate
- Abstract: Concrete is a fundamental material in civil engineering, and its compressive strength is a complex function dependent on age and various ingredients. These ingredients encompass cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate.

**Data Characteristics:**
- Instances: 1030
- Attributes: 9
  - 8 quantitative input variables
  - 1 quantitative output variable (Concrete Compressive Strength in MPa)
- Missing Attribute Values: None
- Data Form: Raw, not scaled

**Variable Information:**
1. Cement (component 1) - Quantitative - kg/m3 mixture - Input Variable
2. Blast Furnace Slag (component 2) - Quantitative - kg/m3 mixture - Input Variable
3. Fly Ash (component 3) - Quantitative - kg/m3 mixture - Input Variable
4. Water (component 4) - Quantitative - kg/m3 mixture - Input Variable
5. Superplasticizer (component 5) - Quantitative - kg/m3 mixture - Input Variable
6. Coarse Aggregate (component 6) - Quantitative - kg/m3 mixture - Input Variable
7. Fine Aggregate (component 7) - Quantitative - kg/m3 mixture - Input Variable
8. Age - Quantitative - Day (1~365) - Input Variable

**Objective:**
- Regression problem to predict concrete compressive strength.

This dataset provides valuable insights for data scientists aiming to model and understand the relationship between concrete composition and its compressive strength, crucial in the field of civil engineering.
